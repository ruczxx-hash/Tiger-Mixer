In time 0's experience:  The system’s interception mechanism appears to prioritize behavioral anomalies that deviate significantly from the low-intensity, sporadic patterns typical of legitimate users. Key updated indicators include: (1) **sustained high transaction rates**—particularly sequences of ≥15 transactions per minute over 5 or more consecutive minutes without meaningful pauses, especially within the first 60 minutes of activity; (2) **high temporal density with minimal entropy**—illegal users exhibit mechanical regularity (e.g., repeated 20–25 tx/min blocks) rather than the irregular, bursty-low rhythm of legitimate actors; (3) **rapid cumulative outflow**—transferring >8–10 ETH within 90 minutes, often in fixed 0.01 ETH increments, signals automated laundering; (4) **bimodal activity cycles**—long dormancy (e.g., 50+ minutes of zero activity) followed by sudden, intense reactivation is highly suspicious, whereas legitimate users show gradual or isolated bursts; and (5) **absence of micro-transactions during active phases**—unlike legitimate users who frequently mix small (1–3 tx) and moderate volumes, intercepted accounts rarely intersperse low-volume minutes during high-output periods. Notably, even if total volume is modest, **concentrated bursts exceeding 0.2 ETH/min for multiple consecutive minutes**—especially early in the session—trigger scrutiny, as do patterns mimicking "batch processing" (e.g., user8’s rigid 30-tx/min for 10 straight minutes). The latest intercepted sequence (user9) further reveals that **sporadic but escalating bursts culminating in large single-minute outputs (e.g., ≥15 tx) after prolonged inactivity** can also flag accounts, suggesting the system now weights *late-stage intensity spikes* following dormancy as high-risk.
