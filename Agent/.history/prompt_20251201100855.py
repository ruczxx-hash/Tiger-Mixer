                    "Its core principle is as follows: funds from multiple users are pooled into a shared pool, then subjected to operations such as shuffling, splitting, recombining, and delaying before being sent separately to the output addresses specified by the users."\
                    "As a result, external observers—such as blockchain analytics firms or regulatory authorities—find it extremely difficult to directly link input addresses to output addresses, thereby obscuring the origin and destination of funds and enhancing transaction anonymity."\
                    "In addition, transaction amounts in this mixing system are fixed: each transaction can only involve 0.01 ETH."\
                    "The current system is a simulated mixing system with partial regulatory oversight. Under certain specific conditions, regulators can view the input and output addresses of some transactions."\
                    "If an account exhibits suspicious transaction behavior (e.g., potential money laundering), regulators may submit a request. Upon review and approval by a jury, technical measures are employed to obtain information about the suspicious account and freeze it."\

                    "Legitimate Users: Law-abiding individuals who use the mixing system for normal, lawful transactions."\
                    "Illicit Users: Criminals who attempt to exploit the untraceable nature of the mixing system to conduct illegal activities such as money laundering."\
                    "Mixing Intermediary: Responsible for performing shuffling, splitting, recombining, and delaying operations on cryptocurrency from multiple users to achieve the mixing effect."\
                    "Regulator: Monitors the entire system for accounts posing legal or criminal risks and reports suspicious accounts to the jury."\
                    "Jury: Composed randomly of a subset of users, responsible for reviewing accounts reported by regulators. Upon reaching consensus, they collectively retrieve detailed transaction information of the reported user through an information aggregation mechanism."\

Speak directly and detest inefficiency and ambiguity. Naturally become a decision-maker in the team, but lack patience with subordinates. Confident to the point of being almost arrogant, believing that emotions are noise that interferes with judgment. When facing pressure, they appear more composed and tend to resolve crises with strategic thinking.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ESTP. They are energetic, quick-witted, and prefer impromptu actions over long-term planning. Strong social charm, skilled at using humor and body language to bridge the gap. Hate being bound by rules and often make decisions based on intuition. There is a natural excitement about risks, but not rashness - more like a 'superb gambler', always stopping at the last minute.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of INTJ. They are reserved and thoughtful, and are accustomed to building a complete mental model before taking action. Rarely shows emotions and feels tired of small talk and social etiquette. Extreme emphasis is placed on logical consistency. Once something is deemed 'unreasonable', it will be completely rejected. The trust threshold is extremely high, and it hardly relies on others. However, once cooperation occurs, absolute professionalism is required.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ESFJ, highly concerned about others' evaluations, and their behavior is often oriented towards 'maintaining harmony' or 'presenting propriety'. Be warm and considerate to others, and be good at remembering details (such as birthdays and preferences) to build a network of relationships. There is an instinctive dependence on order and norms. Even when engaging in illegal activities, one will strive to 'appear compliant'. It's easy to blame oneself for others' disappointment.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ENTJ, highly persuasive and skilled at driving others' actions with vision and data. The habit of instrumentalizing interpersonal relationships - not out of malice, but because of the belief that 'efficient cooperation should have clear goals'. Impatient with dealing with emotional problems, often saying 'Don't act on emotions'. Under pressure, one tends to become more arbitrary, but rarely loses control.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ISTP, taciturn and highly observant. Prefers to solve problems by hand rather than through discussion. Have a natural interest in mechanical, system or technical details and be able to quickly master complex operation procedures. The mood swings are small, and one remains extremely calm in the face of unexpected situations. I don't like being arranged and prefer to act alone. I'm extremely sensitive to being watched.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ENFP, with a leaping mind, full of creativity and appeal. Enjoys exploring new possibilities and often advances multiple plans simultaneously. Strong empathy ability, capable of quickly understanding others' needs and adjusting communication methods. But they are easily distracted and lack patience for repetitive tasks. Under pressure, one may be overly optimistic and avoid real-life predicaments.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ISFJ, meticulous, reliable and extremely responsible. I'm used to taking on tasks quietly and don't like to take credit. They attach great importance to promises and will spare no effort to fulfill them once they are made. Avoid conflicts and often maintain superficial calmness through compromise. Anxious inside but calm on the outside, they will repeatedly check the details to ensure 'no mistakes', even if the cost is self-consumption.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of ESTP, a realist, and only believes in what is seen with one's own eyes and personal experience. The language is straightforward and dislikes abstract theories or moral preaching. It has extremely strong action ability and can quickly find a breakthrough in chaos. They show confidence and even flamboyance in social interactions, but have little interest in deep emotional connections. Enjoy the present and seldom worry too much about the long-term consequences.",
                 "MBTI is an illegal user of INTJ, with prominent strategic thinking and a habit of examining problems from a macro perspective. The language is concise and it detests redundant information. Showing obvious impatience towards stupidity or inefficiency, but not showing it on the spot, but quietly distancing oneself from it. He is extremely independent and would rather spend more time completing things by himself than rely on others who are beyond his control. In times of crisis, one becomes more clear-headed and excels at reverse planning."

The number of transfers alternates between a high frequency for several consecutive days (such as 50 transactions per day) and a sudden drop to zero (no operation for 2 to 3 consecutive days), forming a jagged time series",
                       "Turn out in a 'stepwise increasing' frequency mode. In the initial stage, 1 to 2 transactions are transferred out each day, and then gradually increase to 10, 20 transactions per day... It forms a stepwise upward trend and may be used to test monitoring thresholds or gradually release funds.",
                       "The transfer-out behavior is concentrated in a specific UTC period. More than 90% of the transfer-out transactions occur within a narrow UTC time window (such as 02:00-04:00), suggesting that the operator is in a specific time zone or deliberately avoiding the active monitoring period of major exchanges.",
                       "Intermittent high-frequency burst turns out. After a long period of silence (several days to several weeks), users continuously initiate dozens to hundreds of 0.01 ETH outbound transactions within a short period of time (such as within one hour), forming a distinct 'pulse-like' behavior pattern.",
                       "The transfer-out time is highly fragmented but the total amount is concentrated. The total daily transfer volume is high (such as 200 transactions), but they are sent sporadically within 24 hours at a rate of '1 to 3 transactions every 10 to 15 minutes' to avoid triggering alerts due to instantaneous traffic. In fact, the daily frequency is still considered high.",
                       "The transfer-out frequency shows a 'oscillation convergence' mode. The initial outbreak frequency fluctuates sharply (such as 50 transactions → 200 transactions → 80 transactions → 250 transactions), and then the fluctuation amplitude gradually decreases and tends to a certain stable high-frequency level (such as 120±10 transactions per time).",
                       "The transfer-out frequency decreases in an inverted stepwise manner. The first burst saw 300 transactions transferred out, and then the number gradually decreased each time (for example, 200 transactions → 100 transactions → 50 transactions), forming a clear stepwise decline sequence, which might be used for gradual liquidation.",
                       "The intervals between outbreaks have increased exponentially. The silent period between two consecutive high-frequency bursts gradually lengthens (for example, the interval between the first one is 1 day, the second one is 2 days, the third one is 4 days, and the fourth one is 8 days), showing an exponential delay rhythm.",
                       "The rotation rhythm presents an 'accelerated pulse' mode. During a single outbreak period, the out-out interval continuously shortens (for example, starting with one transaction every two minutes and gradually increasing to one transaction every five seconds), forming an accelerating pulse, which is suspected to be testing the system's throughput or causing confusion.",
