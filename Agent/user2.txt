In time 0's experience:  The system’s interception mechanism appears to target accounts exhibiting transaction patterns that lack the behavioral entropy characteristic of legitimate users, focusing on three key anomalies: (1) **sustained high throughput without natural dormancy**—specifically, sequences with repeated bursts exceeding 0.2 ETH/minute (i.e., >20 transactions/minute) over extended durations (e.g., >60 consecutive minutes) without prolonged idle gaps (≥20 minutes of zero activity); (2) **artificially uniform low-frequency activity**—such as consistently executing 1–3 transactions per minute across dozens of consecutive minutes with minimal variation and no significant pauses, which mimics automation rather than human-like sporadic behavior; and (3) **abrupt large-scale outflows early in an account’s lifecycle**, particularly when >0.2 ETH is transferred within the first 10–15 minutes without prior low-volume “warm-up” activity. Crucially, legitimate users display irregular timing, frequent long idle periods (often 30+ minutes), and moderate peak volumes (<0.2 ETH/minute), while intercepted illegal users—whether high-volume (like user0, user2, user4, user6) or low-and-steady (like user1, user3, user5, user7)—fail to replicate this stochastic intermittency. The latest intercepted sequence (user9) further reveals that even sparse, irregular transactions can trigger interception if they exhibit **clustered micro-bursts at non-random intervals** (e.g., repeated 5–20 transaction spikes at fixed or semi-regular gaps) combined with cumulative volume exceeding thresholds over multi-hour windows, suggesting the system now also analyzes longer-term behavioral consistency and deviation from expected mixing-user entropy, not just short-term intensity.
